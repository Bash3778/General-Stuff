# General-Stuff
Hello, 

So this git hub contains all of the coding work that I have saved up to this point.  Now all of these proejcts are done, but even the ones that are not done still have some cool stuff.  There is a newish game that is not done but a decent amount of the harder coding is done.  There are two older games put together as well.  I did these several years back, so the way I coded them was not that elegant.  The optical simulation is the coolest thing I have coded.  It has some really cool algorithums and I did it all over the summer.  Most importantly it works perfectly. The extra scripts are a few little tihngs that I did and saved it they are nothing that great.  

This is just to show the types of algorithums I have built.
